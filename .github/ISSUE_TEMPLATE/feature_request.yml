      placeholder: |
        Example: When searching for music in Lidarr, there's no way to use Ygégé because it doesn't support audio categories. This forces me to use other indexers, fragmenting my setup.

      label: "Proposed Solution"
      description: "How should this feature work? Be as detailed as possible."
      placeholder: |
        Example: Add support for audio categories (2139-2150) in the API:
        - Implement music-search mode with artist, album, label parameters
        - Map Prowlarr audio categories (3000-3050) to YGG audio cats
        - Add Lidarr-specific search logic using artist/album names

      placeholder: |
        Example: 
        - Using manual text searches works but doesn't leverage metadata
        - Could use another indexer but want to centralize on Ygégé
        - Tried custom Prowlarr filters but results are inconsistent
